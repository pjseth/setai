This is an AI I am developing to beat my best friend Vishnu in Set

Making the deck:
    Simple list of cards that includes the shapes, color, number, and shadings
    Just a bunch of loops to geenrate all 81 possible cards
    Using random to shuffle the cards and return the deck
    I also formatted it using f strings to make the formatting look better

Matching the cards:
    This one is very tricky. I need to create a list of cards that would check if all 4 properties
    are either all the same or all different. 
        They all have the same number or have three different numbers.
        They all have the same shape or have three different shapes.
        They all have the same shading or have three different shadings.
        They all have the same color or have three different colors.
